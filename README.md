## Reflection

- I created Elance while attending Actualize's Coding Bootcamp. This is a culmination of the skills learned to develop a full-stack application.

- As a professional dancer, the moments I was between gigs were particulary challenging with not knowing where to network to find work. I wanted to create a           platform where dancers and employers can connect, helping bridge the gap between a dancer's next job.
 
- This project taught me a lot about project planning. I learned the days when I had set intentions of what I was going to work on were the days when I was most       productive. Elance was also the first project that I deployed which presented a few challenges but I was able to get it hosted, and I'm so happy with how it         looks live! 
  
- I ran into an obstacle when implementing a file uploading library, CarrierWave, so dancers can upload their resumes. I spent a two days trying to get this           libary to work and had no success. I then used Cloudinary as my file uploading libray and was sucessful!
